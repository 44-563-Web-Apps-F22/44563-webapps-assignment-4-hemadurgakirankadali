            <h5>ACT I Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
                seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
                A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
                of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
                on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
                grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
                the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
                they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]
