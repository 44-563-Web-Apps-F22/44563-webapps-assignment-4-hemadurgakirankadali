            <h5>ACT I Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
                seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
                A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
                of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
                on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
                grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
                the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
                they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.]
                          No. 1. Twenty love-sick maidens we
                              (Opening Chorus and Solos)
                              Maidens, Angela, and Ella</h5>
            <p>
              <p>  ANGELA    Love feeds on hope, they say, or love will die; </p>

                <p>   MAIDENS        Ah, miserie! </p>
              
                    <p>    ANGELA    Yet my love lives, although no hope have I! </p>
              
                        <p>   MAIDENS        Ah, miserie! </p>
              
                            <p>    ANGELA    Alas, poor heart, go hide thyself away,
                          To weeping concords tune thy roundelay!
                          Ah, miserie! </p>
              
                          <p>    MAIDENS   All our love is all for one,
                               Yet that love he heedeth not,
                          He is coy and cares for none,
                               Sad and sorry is our lot!
                                        Ah, miserie! </p>
              
                                        <p>     ELLA      Go, breaking heart,
                               Go, dream of love requited!
                          Go, foolish heart,
                               Go, dream of lovers plighted;
                          Go, madcap heart,
                               Go, dream of never waking;
                          And in thy dream
                               Forget that thou art breaking! </p>
              
                               <p>    MAIDENS                 Ah, miserie! </p>
              
                                <p>    ELLA           Forget that thou art breaking! </p>
              
                                    <p>    MAIDENS   Twenty love-sick maidens we,
                               Love-sick all against our will.
                          Twenty years hence we shall be
                               Twenty love-sick maidens still.
                                        Ah, miserie! </p>
              
                                        <p>   ANGELA  There is a strange magic in this love of ours!  Rivals as
                we all are in the affections of our Reginald, the very
                hopelessness of our love is a bond that binds us to one another! </p>
              
                <p>    SAPHIR  Jealousy is merged in misery.  While he, the very
                cynosure of our eyes and hearts, remains icy insensible â€” what
                have we to strive for? </p>
              
                <p>  ELLA  The love of maidens is, to him, as interesting as the
                taxes! </p>
              
                <p>   SAPHIR  Would that it were!  He pays his taxes. </p>
