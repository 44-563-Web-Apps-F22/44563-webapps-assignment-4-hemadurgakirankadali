  <h6 class="ANGELA">ANGELA</h6> <p class="speech"> And cherishes the receipts!</p>

  <p class="direction">[Enter LADY JANE, L.U.E.]</p> 

  <h6 class="SAPHIR">SAPHIR</h6> <p class="speech">Happy receipts!</p>  <p class="direction">[All sigh heavily]</p> 

  <h6 class="JANE">JANE </h6><p class="direction"> [L.C., suddenly] Fools!</p> <p class="direction">[They start, and turn to her]</p>  

  <h6 class="ANGELA">ANGELA</h6>  <p class="speech">I beg your pardon?</p>

  <h6 class="JANE">JANE </h6> <p class="speech">andFools blind!  The man loves — wildly loves!</p> 

  <h6 class="ANGELA">ANGELA</h6> <p class="speech"> But whom?  None of us!</p>

  <h6 class="JANE">JANE </h6> <p class="speech">No, none of us.  His weird fancy has lighted, for the
    nonce, on Patience, the village milkmaid!</p> 
  <h6 class="SAPHIR">SAPHIR</h6><p class="speech">  On Patience?  Oh, it cannot be!</p>

  <h6 class="JANE">JANE </h6> <p class="speech">Bah!  But yesterday I caught him in her dairy, eating fresh
    butter with a tablespoon.  Today he is not well!</p> 

  <h6 class="SAPHIR">SAPHIR</h6><p class="speech"> But Patience boasts that she has never loved — that love
    is, to her, a sealed book!  Oh, he cannot be serious!</p> 
  <h6 class="JANE">JANE </h6> <p class="speech">`Tis but a fleeting fancy — `twill quickly wear away.
    [aside, coming down-stage]  Oh, Reginald, if you but knew what a
    wealth of golden love is waiting for you, stored up in this
    rugged old bosom of mine, the milkmaid's triumph would be short
    indeed!</p>
